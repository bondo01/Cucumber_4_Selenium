# Cucumber_4_Selenium
A single place for all the needed Cucumber files to use with Selenium


The plan is to keep all the needed files to run the latest verion of all the files to use Cucumber with Selenium.
Like every open source project that depends on other open source files not every update works with everything needed 
to run with a usage that the creators/maintainers of those dependancies know about those uses. Its up to the team/creator
of this usage to verify the compatibility of any required module or it's update.
